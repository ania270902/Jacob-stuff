### Guides on Getting Into It
***
A Guide to MIRI’s Research by Nate Soares: https://intelligence.org/research-guide/
	This guide briefly overviews our research priorities, and **provides resources that will help you get to the cutting edge on each subject area.** ... This research guide is based around our [Agent Foundations agenda](https://intelligence.org/technical-agenda). 

MIRI's [Alignment Research Field Guide](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/PqMT9zGrNsGJNfiFR/alignment-research-field-guide)

==other good ones? Find any other worthwhile guides for "getting into alignment research and stuff". Give me a little summary==

### Intro to Agent Foundations
***
MIRI
	For an in-depth introduction to some of the problems we are working on, see our [“Agent Foundations” research agenda](https://intelligence.org/technical-agenda/) and “[Embedded Agency](https://intelligence.org/embedded-agency/).”

==pretty sure Miri is the only place that gives a shit about this approach, but see if you can find other explainers or orgs/people who are doing this kind of work. I'm kind of curious if there are other people taking the "agent theoretic approach" seriously==

### Intro to ML
***
From [Center for AI Safety](https://safe.ai) ML Safety Course
	If you don’t have this background, we recommend Week 1-6 of [MIT 6.036](https://openlearninglibrary.mit.edu/courses/course-v1:MITx+6.036+1T2019/course/) followed by Lectures 1-13 of the [University of Michigan’s EECS498](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~justincj/teaching/eecs498/FA2019/schedule.html) or Week 1-6 and 11-12 of [NYU’s Deep Learning](https://atcold.github.io/pytorch-Deep-Learning/).

==anything else that's free and gives a comprehensive intro to ML? I think Miri has book reccs?==

==I== found some Stanford stuff and it made me have a different idea. Still look into other intros and stuff, but I realized that there are probably a lot of intros and they're probably all fine and easy to find, but that I probably could use more help finding upper division courses and such, so I added the instructions below:

==Stanford== Online's Graduate Course Lectures and Seminars had a bunch of stuff related to ML and some stuff related directly to AI safety. Go ahead and aggregate all the relevant playlists/courses/seminars from this channel into some format where I can look at them all pretty easily. Please don't miss stuff (but you don't need to include everything either). If you're in doubt, look up the words you don't know. If you're still unsure, just include it. https://www.youtube.com/@stanfordonline/playlists

After that, could you look up a few other major universities MIT, Harvard, whatever. It doesn't even have to be prestitgious, I just think that's your best bet tbh. Try to see if you can find full courses related to CS and ML. I'm sure you'll find a ton. I just want to get a sense of what's out there. There will probably be a lot of intro classes, but tbh those are easy to find so I am especially interested in 200, 300, and 400 level courses. It would be really cool if you found the degree requirements (should be online somewhere; search for the school's degree catalog) for an ML degree or AI degree or something like that. If you found that and tried to find a bunch of corresponding courses online and had that all in a nice document or something for me to look at, that would be really helpful. Obviously, I don't care about the generals and shit, just the actual AI/ML stuff. I will be able to cut out a good amount of time (maybe ~1/2) by not doing the generals. Plus, I already have some familiarity with CS, so I expect to be able to do the first ~1/3 about 2x faster than the rest of it. I can probably go like 2 or 3x faster than a college course if I just focus on learning the important concepts, so I expect it to take me like (28 months/2 * (1/3 * 1/2 + 2/3) / 2) = 5.8333, so I should be able to kill the equivalent of a Bachelor's degree in ML in ~6 months if I focus. I will probably rework the curriculum considerably, so really I am just using their degree requirements as a suggestion. See what you can find though. It would be nice to know that I can watch all the lectures online, but realistically I might have to just go off of textbooks for some of the classes.

### Intro to Relevant Mathematics
***
Light intros/visual intros to [Linear Algebra](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab) / [Neural Nets](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi) / [Calculus](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr) by 3B1B

Harvard [CS50](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhQjrBD2T380F_inVRXMIHCqLaNUd7bN4) 2022

==Find some good courses for the relevant math. Maybe Khan academy (check if its any good). Textbooks would be good too==
MIRI has some reccomendations in their guide for what to [study](https://intelligence.org/research-guide/). I think I mostly need linear algebra, statistics, and probably some probability theory.

### Intro to Alignment / ML Safety
***
https://course.mlsafety.org/about

https://www.agisafetyfundamentals.com/ai-alignment-curriculum

==Find the courses people have made. I think Ngo has one for this and one for governance. Try to look through them/look at what people are saying about them and compare/summarize/say something useful about them bc it's not like I have time to take all of them==

## Policy/Strategy
***
Find ==N==go's guide/course or whatever

==F==ind a decent guide or two (I do mean decent. I have seen a lot of governance/policy intros that are really shit and don't actually say anything)

==It== would be cool if you found a list of policy proposals and gave me a brief description of all of them, but that is extra. I will probably add that to the list separate.


### Other
***
**The Thoughts of Relevant Experts/Important Figures**
	Yudkowsky Summaries
	MIRI Overviews
	Soares Summaries
	Wentworth
	Christiano
	Ngo
	The agreement/discussion posts might be particularly fruitful

==there are some important big guys in the field who have had debates I have barely been able to follow and that I mostly haven't read. If you can find the important discussions between these guys (and I do mean important bc there's books and books worth of text written by all these guys) that would be cool. Summary points on their main disagreements would be cool. If possible, I want to only have to read like 8 hours worth of shit and kind of get their key takes and key disagreements.==

Overview of Cruxes

==A lot of people disagree about they key stuff. I want to know the main points of disagreement. This relates to the last thing a lot. I just want you too find a few things for me to read on FOOM and slow vs fast takeoff (also heard it as fast vs discontinuous). Try to find anything else like that too where it was a main point of argument for the big guys.==

Overview of Key Actors
==(this is too much for you right now, don't worry about it)==

**Schools of Thought**
	Shard Theory
	Prosaic
	Interated amplification
	==find== more schools of thought like this (there should be loads like this ~10 maybe, but I can't think of them)

==Look== over this draft paper. 
	When the guy sent it to me, there were a ton of gaps still and it didn't seem worth reading yet. Try to see if there is good info on there and what parts are finished. I don't know if I'm allowed to share it or what the ettiquitte there is, but he private messaged me the link even though we met in the comments so I think he might be keeping it at least kind of private. So, please sign out of your google account before accessing [it](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pwwNHvNeJneBA2t2xaP31lVv1lSpa36w8kdryoS5768/edit#) and probably only make suggestions if you are confident you having something to add (you can switch into view mode so you don't suggest shit by accident).

	I'm particularly interested in the "Current state of AI development ecosystem", the governance stuff, Solution-focused work: key actors, levers, pathways, and proposals, and Prioritization-focused work: comparing theories of action. You don't have to read the whole thing, but skim it and see if it is worth reading yet or if it is still too unfinished to really offer much value.
